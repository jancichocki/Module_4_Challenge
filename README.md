# Portfolio Performance Analysis: A Comprehensive Study

## Introduction

Welcome to the Portfolio Performance Analysis project repository! This project entails a thorough examination of various investment portfolios, encompassing those managed by prominent investors, hedge funds, and algorithmic strategies, juxtaposed against the S&P 500 Index. This document provides a detailed guide on navigating the repository and comprehending the analysis conducted.

## Project Overview

The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of different investment portfolios, including those managed by renowned investors ("whales"), algorithmic trading strategies, and benchmark indices. The analysis spans data cleaning, quantitative assessment, risk evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Detailed Analysis

### Data Cleaning

The initial step involves importing CSV files into DataFrames and performing meticulous data cleaning, encompassing handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

### Performance Analysis

#### Daily Returns

We compute and visualize the daily returns of all portfolios to discern their performance trends over time.

#### Cumulative Returns

Cumulative returns are calculated and plotted to ascertain the overall performance of each portfolio.

### Risk Analysis

#### Standard Deviation

Portfolio risk is determined by computing the standard deviation of daily returns, with box plots employed for visual risk comparison.

#### Sharpe Ratios

The Sharpe ratio is calculated to gauge the risk-adjusted return of each portfolio, aiding investors in making informed decisions.

### Rolling Statistics

Analysis of rolling statistics enables understanding the dynamic nature of risk and correlations over time, encompassing rolling standard deviations and correlations between portfolios.

### Custom Portfolio

In addition to evaluating existing portfolios, a custom portfolio comprising selected stocks is created. Weighted returns, cumulative returns, and risk assessment are performed using methodologies akin to other portfolios.

### Conclusion

This project furnishes a comprehensive analysis of various investment portfolios, proffering insights into their performance, risk profiles, and correlations vis-Ã -vis benchmarks like the S&P 500 Index. Armed with this knowledge, investors can make judicious decisions to optimize their investment strategies.
